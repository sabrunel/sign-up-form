# Project overview

This is the first project from the [Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css) of the Odin Project.

The aim is to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service. 
Not sure what this particular one is about though, I just fell in love with the picture. :smile:

A live preview of the project is available [here](https://sabrunel.github.io/sign-up-form/).

# What I learned

- HTML forms
- More use cases for CSS grid, such as responsive form styling (thank you [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHregeIsjPQ)!)

# What's next

This form needs some user input validation.
